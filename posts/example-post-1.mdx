# Getting Started


## Introduction to Zeon

Zeon is a **quantum computing framework** built for advanced particle physics simulations. The platform combines **quantum mechanics** with modern computing to create a powerful research tool.

### Quick Setup

#### 1. Install Zeon via npm:

```
npm install quantum-zeon-sim
```

#### 2. Initialize Zeon in your project:

```
import { ZeonSim } from 'quantum-zeon-sim';

const Zeon = new zeonSim({
    quantumMode: true,
    // Additional configuration options
});
```

### Quantum Operations

Zeon provides **quantum simulation capabilities** with advanced particle modeling:

*   Quantum entanglement simulation
*   Wave function calculations
*   Particle interaction modeling
*   Quantum field analysis

### Physics Engine Features

Leverage Zeon's **physics capabilities** for:

*   Particle collision simulation
*   Quantum tunneling effects
*   Orbital mechanics
*   Gravitational field mapping

***

### Basic Integration

Follow these steps to integrate Zeon into your physics simulation environment:

```
// Configure Zeon settings
const config = {
    dimensions: '3D',
    particleCount: 1000,
    timeStep: 0.001
};

// Initialize Zeon instance
const Zeon = new ZeonSim(config);

// Start quantum simulation
Zeon.simulate();
```

### Advanced Configuration

Customize Zeon's behavior with advanced settings:

*   Quantum field parameters
*   Particle interaction rules
*   Simulation boundaries
*   Energy conservation settings

### System Requirements

Minimum system requirements for running Zeon:

*   64-bit processor
*   16GB RAM recommended
*   CUDA-compatible GPU
*   Linux/Unix environment
