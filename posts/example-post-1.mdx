# Getting Started


## Introduction to Xavoc

Xavoc is a **quantum computing framework** built for advanced particle physics simulations. The platform combines **quantum mechanics** with modern computing to create a powerful research tool.

### Quick Setup

#### 1. Install Xavoc via npm:

```
npm install quantum-xavoc-sim
```

#### 2. Initialize Xavoc in your project:

```
import { XavocSim } from 'quantum-xavoc-sim';

const xavoc = new XavocSim({
    quantumMode: true,
    // Additional configuration options
});
```

### Quantum Operations

Xavoc provides **quantum simulation capabilities** with advanced particle modeling:

*   Quantum entanglement simulation
*   Wave function calculations
*   Particle interaction modeling
*   Quantum field analysis

### Physics Engine Features

Leverage Xavoc's **physics capabilities** for:

*   Particle collision simulation
*   Quantum tunneling effects
*   Orbital mechanics
*   Gravitational field mapping

***

### Basic Integration

Follow these steps to integrate Xavoc into your physics simulation environment:

```
// Configure Xavoc settings
const config = {
    dimensions: '3D',
    particleCount: 1000,
    timeStep: 0.001
};

// Initialize Xavoc instance
const xavoc = new XavocSim(config);

// Start quantum simulation
xavoc.simulate();
```

### Advanced Configuration

Customize Xavoc's behavior with advanced settings:

*   Quantum field parameters
